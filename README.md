# AvFull
Python script for making AvFull orders by TNT

Right now this consists from only one Python script ripped
off from our project (Do pr√°ce na kole). We don't use TNT anymore,
but we are opening this sciprt for anyone with intention, that 
it might evolve into reusable application/module.

Although it is not prepared for instant reuse,
it can be relatively easy to adapt this to your needs.
